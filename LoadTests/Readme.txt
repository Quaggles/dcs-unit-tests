Tracks beginning with "LoadTest." are used to determine if a module can be loaded as a player aircraft correctly in the sim, if this fails all tests using this aircraft will automatically be marked as failed to save time

These missions are generated from template files ".base.*.trk" which feeds in the aircraft types from PlayableAircraftTypes.lua and PlayableHelicoptersTypes.lua using CreateMissionsFromTemplates.ps1 in the dcs-unit-tester repository
